- Bash scripting gives users the power of the commandline while allowing the automative capabilities of scripting. 

- Say you have a script you want to run, in this example lets say its a simple counter that goes from 0 to some power of 2. I have one written in Python below. 

```python  
#!/usr/bin/env python  

import math  

t = int(raw_input())
x = 2**t  

count = 0
while count < x:
	count = count + 1

print count
```  

- Here the program takes in __stdin__ or Standard Input. This means when you run it, you will be prompted to enter something. In this case its wants a number.
