- Bash scripting gives users the power of the commandline while allowing the automative capabilities of scripting. 

Say you have a script you want to run, in this example lets say its a simple counter that goes from 0 to some power of 2. I have one written in Python below. Lets call it __prog.py__.  

```python  
#!/usr/bin/env python  

import math  

t = int(raw_input())
x = 2**t  

count = 0
while count < x:
	count = count + 1

print count
```  

Here the program takes in __stdin__ or Standard Input. This means when you run it, you will be prompted to enter something. 
> In this case its wants a number. 
Running it, if you enter say 5, it will print 32 to the terminal. 

```bash
$ ./prog.py
5
32
```
Now say you wanted to run this program for a range of numbers from 5 to 25. You could modify this program to do this, also you can do it just as simply in bash scripting.
